# ​ 🚀 Fake News Detection with LSTM & Bi-LSTM

##  📖Project Overview
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook implementations for detecting fake news using deep learning:

- **FakeNewsLSTM.ipynb** – Implements an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model.
- **FakeNewswithBi_LSTm.ipynb** – Implements a Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional LSTM) model.

Both models are designed to classify news articles as *fake* or *real*, enabling a direct comparison of their performance.

## 📈 Results

| Model     | Accuracy | Loss   |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| LSTM      | 87%      | 0.2072 |
| Bi-LSTM   | 91%      | 0.1772 |

📊 **Observation:** The Bi-LSTM model outperformed the LSTM model by 4% in accuracy and achieved a lower loss, showing better generalization.

# Insights
• LSTM effectively captures sequences in one direction.\
• Bi-LSTM leverages bidirectional context, which may enhance accuracy.\
• Initial experiments suggest Bi-LSTM may outperform LSTM, but you should confirm with your results.

# Future Enhancements
• Add GRU, Transformer, or BERT based models\
• Test pre-trained embeddings (e.g., GloVe, Word2Vec)\
• Automate evaluation: generate metrics and graphical comparisons\
• Package as a deployable app or API
